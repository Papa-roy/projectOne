    <b>A Tale Of Two Cities</b>

    <h2>By Charles Dickens</h2>

      The year is 1775, and social ills plague both France and England. Jerry
      Cruncher, an odd-job man who works for Tellson’s Bank, stops the Dover
      mail-coach with an urgent message for Jarvis Lorry. The message instructs
      Lorry to wait at Dover for a young woman, and Lorry responds with the
      cryptic words, “Recalled to Life.” At Dover, Lorry is met by Lucie
      Manette, a young orphan whose father, a once-eminent doctor whom she
      supposed dead, has been discovered in France. Lorry escorts Lucie to
      Paris, where they meet Defarge, a former servant of Doctor Manette, who
      has kept Manette safe in a garret. Driven mad by eighteen years in the
      Bastille, Manette spends all of his time making shoes, a hobby he learned
      while in prison. Lorry assures Lucie that her love and devotion can recall
      her father to life, and indeed they do.

      The year is now 1780. Charles Darnay stands accused of treason against the
      English crown. A bombastic lawyer named Stryver pleads Darnay’s case, but
      it is not until his drunk, good-for-nothing colleague, Sydney Carton,
      assists him that the court acquits Darnay. Carton clinches his argument by
      pointing out that he himself bears an uncanny resemblance to the
      defendant, which undermines the prosecution’s case for unmistakably
      identifying Darnay as the spy the authorities spotted. Lucie and Doctor
      Manette watched the court proceedings, and that night, Carton escorts
      Darnay to a tavern and asks how it feels to receive the sympathy of a
      woman like Lucie. Carton despises and resents Darnay because he reminds
      him of all that he himself has given up and might have been.
